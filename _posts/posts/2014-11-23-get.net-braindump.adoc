title: GET.NET Braindump
excerpt: Random notes from Udi Dahan keynote during get.net conference in Gda≈Ñsk (22/11/2014)
---
I had this enormous honour to speak (as the only Java guy) at a .NET conference. I was mainly covering clean code and good coding practices - still I found it a twist. However, it's not link:{% post_url speaking/2014-11-22-get.net-gdansk %}[my "Revers engineering the clean code" talk] I'd like to focus on; here are some notes from Udi Dahan's keynote "So you think you know pub/sub?"


== So you think you know pub/sub?

* Is about logical not physical data distribution
** each event should be processed one
** scale physical environment independently of logical architecture 

* Isn't it what micro services are talking about?
* If you've been coding for an hour and you haven't touched a single domain problem - stop. You probably writing infrastructure...
* Stop every hour and review what you've done - check if that's not infrastructure 

* Make the coupling visible. It's not about hiding the coupling you already have. Seek out autonomy but preserve the single source of truth. 
** single source of truth doesn't imply shared database
** have a single source per context
** design logical decoupling and later on decide on physical model - putting it onto a single database. 

* Events are facts. Not commands - things we would like to happen

* Two type of failures. Technical and business failures 
** technical failure: developers causing business failures
** don't deal with business failures as technical problems

* Sensors, stock market - client based filtering. Notify me of some data. 
** distributed cache 
** user machines poll the cache of the content. 
* When user come along, it filters the local cache. 
* Pub/Sub content based filtering - will be inefficient.
