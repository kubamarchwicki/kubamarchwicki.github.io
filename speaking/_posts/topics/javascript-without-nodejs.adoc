=== Abstract

People have mixed feelings about JavaScript (me included). On one hand, JavaScript is easy to bash - you know all the PHP joke, ain't you; on the other - whatever can be written in JavaScript, will be written (Atwood Law, 2007). So, no matter what you do know - getting familiar with JavaScript is not a question why but when. And if you haven't tried it yet - this is a session for you.

Whenever you try to start - with which ever framework / library - it usually starts with an infamous `npm install {library-to-try}` and quickly new things come into play: gulp, grunt etc. It's like in Java, everything starts with Maven / Gradle dependency. However, when you start fresh - these all just make the learning curve steeper.

In this session I'll make a digestible walk through a set of JavaScript tools, technologies, conventions, which can make it easy for you (a backend engineer) get on the JavaScript bandwagon. Obviously, there will be a flavour of node, npm, build tools in it - but not in the first place. They will come kind of naturally.
